# Lab 04 — JavaScript Basics

## Quick Start
1. Open the `index.html` file in the lab 04 folder or click live portfolio page.
2. Interact with the number guessing game by clicking the up/down buttons to set your guess and then pressing the submit button.
3. Observe the feedback clues displayed below the game area and the number of attempts remaining.
4. Try to guess the correct number between 000–999 before running out of attempts.

## Reflections
This lab helped me understand core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with classes and objects. Overall, I gained practical experience connecting JavaScript logic with HTML elements and creating an interactive web application.
