# Lab 03 â€” Bootstrap & Responsive Layouts

## Quick Start
1. Open the index.html file in the lab 3 folder.
2. Explore the different Bootstrap components, including the navbar, carousel, and responsive grid layouts.
3. Resize the browser window to see the responsive behavior in action.

## Reflections
This lab helped me understand how to use Bootstrap to build responsive web pages. I learned how to implement a navbar with collapsible menus, create carousels with indicators and controls, and use grid and flex utilities to align content. I also practiced linking assets from other directories and making layouts adapt to different screen sizes.
