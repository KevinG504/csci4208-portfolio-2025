# Lab 05 â€” Phaser Game Dodger

## Quick Start
1. Launch a local server in the `phaser-game-dodger` folder 
2. Open `http://localhost:8080/index.html` in your browser.
3. Press the spacebar to start the game, use the arrow keys to move, and spacebar to fire.
4. Collect power-ups, dodge enemies, and try to get the highest score.

## Reflections
This lab helped me understand how to use Phaser to build a small arcade game. I learned how to load assets, create scenes, and manage collisions between players, enemies, and power-ups. It gave me practice organizing code across multiple files and connecting everything into a working game.
