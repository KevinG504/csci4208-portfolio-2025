# Lab 01 â€” HTML-first Interactive Game

## Quick Start
1. Open the index.html file in the lab folder.
2. Play the game. It uses basic HTML.

## Reflections
The lab was a cool introduction to HTML. It showed me the capabilities, such as branching, audio, and gif visuals. I also learned about the structure of multiple pages in a single project and how to organize assets in separate folders. The lab helped me understand how minimal javascript can make interactive games.
